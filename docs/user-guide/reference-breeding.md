# Breeding Reference

Quick lookup table for every breed's breeding window, gestation length, and litter sizes. Use this when planning herds: when you can buy juveniles for breeding, when males retire, how long pregnancy takes, and how many offspring to budget pen space for.

For per-species context (food, prices, fertility-by-age curves, complications) see the species factsheets and the [Breeding Guide](guide-breeding.md).

## Reference Table

Each breed has two rows - one for females, one for males. Gestation and litter size are female-only stats, so the male row leaves those columns blank.

¹ The male upper limit is scaled by individual fertility genetics. A high-fertility bull may breed past 132 months; a low-fertility one retires earlier. Roosters are the exception: their 72-month cap is absolute and not scaled by genetics. The female limit is the hard end of the fertility curve.

² "Peak" is the typical litter size when a healthy mother conceives. "Max" is the upper bound seen with high-fertility mothers in good condition. Litter size also depends on age (very young and very old mothers have smaller litters).

³ Breed-locked: Water Buffalo only breed with Water Buffalo; Goats only breed with Ram Goats. All other breeds within a species can cross-breed (Angus bull x Holstein cow, Berkshire boar x Landrace sow, etc.). See the [Breeding Guide](guide-breeding.md#breed-restrictions).

> **Health gate:** Every species requires the female to be at **75%+ health** for breeding. Below 75%, conception fails entirely; below 60%, the mother risks death during birth. See the [Breeding Guide](guide-breeding.md#pregnancy-complications) for full mechanics.

## At a Glance

A few patterns worth highlighting:

- **Pigs have the shortest male window.** Boars retire at 4 years while sows breed until 8 - replace breeding boars early.
- **Sheep and goats also asymmetric.** Rams retire at 6 years, ewes/does breed until 10.
- **Does and ewes now match.** Goats breed from 8 months, the same as sheep - goats are no longer the late starter.
- **Horses are the slowest cycle.** 11-month gestation and single foals make horse breeding a long-term investment.
- **Pigs are the fastest.** 4-month gestation plus 12-piglet litters means a healthy sow produces 30+ piglets per year at prime age.
- **Roosters retire at 6 years.** A rooster sires until 72 months, then stops - unlike other males, the cap is fixed, not genetics-scaled.
